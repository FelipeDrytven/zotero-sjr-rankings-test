# Zotero SJR Rankings (ZSC)
This add-on for Zotero tags journal articles with SJR journal quantiles and inserts a journal's "H index" to the "journal abbreviation" field. While a hack, it allows you to use that column to sort/filter.

## Installation
To install the add-on for Zotero:
1. Download the lastest version of the add-on from [the release page](https://github.com/Jacse/zotero-sjr-rankings/releases). It's an ".xpi" file.
1. In Zotero go to Tools -> Add-ons and drag the ".xpi" file into the window. Click restart Zotero.

## Usage
Right click a the journal articles you want to fetch SJR quantiles for and click "Update SJR ranking(s)".
